# PhotonWaterController
Photon (Particle.io) firmware and single page webapp for a basic watering system controller.

This is the code behind an electronics project I recently finished (enough to be useful), which is a basic solenoid controller for garden watering systems. At this stage, it simply turns on a channel for a set time by setting a digital pin high.

A Particle.io account and associated API key will be required to use this code. This code also assumes that the project is driven by the [Particle Photon](https://www.particle.io/products/hardware/photon-wifi-dev-kit) IoT microcrontoller.
