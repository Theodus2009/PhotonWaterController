#waterControl single page web app

watercOntrol.html is a very basic single page web application that allows you to remotely setart watering of your plants, by talking through the Particle cloud to a Photon previously flashed with appropriate firmware. A Particle.io account will be required to use this file.

This self-contained HTML file is all that is required - just put it on any web server (any all) and use it from a device of your choice. Any modern browser should have no trouble showing this page, though local storage is required, and all CSS is non-prefixed.
